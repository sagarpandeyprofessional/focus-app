# UX Flows & Interaction Design

## 1. Design Principles
- Default should require zero decisions
- Presenter intent drives attention
- Viewer autonomy without fragmentation

---

## 2. Presenter Flow

1. Start session
2. Select displays to share
3. Enable auto-focus (default ON)
4. Present naturally
5. Optional: freeze or manually switch focus

---

## 3. Viewer Flow (Default)

1. Join session
2. Auto-follow presenter focus
3. Observe focus indicators

No action required.

---

## 4. Viewer Override Flow

1. Viewer pins a screen
2. System exits auto-follow
3. Viewer explores independently
4. One-click return to auto-follow

---

## 5. Focus Transition UX
- Soft highlight on target screen
- Delayed hard switch (~500ms)
- PiP shows previous context briefly

---

## 6. Visual Indicators
- Active screen border glow
- Tooltip: "Presenter is on Screen X"
- Mini screen map (optional)

---

## 7. Edge Case UX

### Presenter Idle
- Freeze focus
- No auto-switching

### Network Degradation
- Reduce inactive stream quality
- Notify viewer subtly

---

## 8. Accessibility
- Keyboard shortcuts
- High-contrast focus indicators
- Motion-reduction mode

---

## 9. UX Anti-Goals
- No mandatory viewer choices
- No complex configuration screens
- No unexpected focus jumps
